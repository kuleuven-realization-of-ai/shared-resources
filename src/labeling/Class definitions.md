* Can be happy and angry at the same time when there are two faces
* Because there is a whole continuum of emotions between fully angry and happy, here are some more guidelines for happy and angry:
    * Eyebrows downward with mouth upwards = angry

    * Showing teeth without smile or eyebrows (or are flat) ðŸ˜¬ = nothing
